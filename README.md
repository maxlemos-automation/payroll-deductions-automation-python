# Payroll Deductions Automation

This project automates the process of converting employee deduction data into a payroll-ready TXT file used by the **Metiri** payroll system.

It reads raw deduction data from Excel, maps deduction codes, formats the structure, and exports a clean .txt file ready for import.

### ⚙️ What the automation does

- Reads a source Excel file with employee deductions (`employee_deductions.xlsx`)
- Cleans and reshapes data (missing values → zero, wide → long transformation)
- Maps deduction descriptions to system codes (`deduction_codes.xlsx`)
- Generates a payroll-import TXT file formatted for Metiri (semicolon `;` separated, no header)

### 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `process_deductions.ipynb` | Full automation logic (step-by-step Jupyter notebook) |
| `employee_deductions.xlsx` | Example anonymized input file |
| `deduction_codes.xlsx` | Mapping: deduction name → payroll system code |
| `example_output.txt` | Example payroll import file generated by the script |

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas)
- Excel (for input files)
- TXT export formatting

### 🔒 Privacy & Authenticity

This project is based on a **real payroll automation solution** developed for a company.  
All employee-specific information has been **fully anonymized** to ensure privacy compliance.  
Original field names (Spanish) were kept to preserve **business terminology** from the real workflow.

### ▶️ How to Run (Quick)

1. Open `process_deductions.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
2. Place the Excel files in the same folder as the notebook
3. Run the cells from top to bottom
4. The script creates `payroll_import.txt` — ready for Metiri system upload

### 🚀 Future Improvements

- Validation warnings for missing deduction code mappings
- Add Streamlit or CLI tool for file upload and automatic TXT export
- Include unit tests for amount formatting and column structure
